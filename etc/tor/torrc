## The IP address or hostname for incoming connections (leave commented and Tor will guess)
## [NEW FEATURE] Relay IPv6 Address Discovery - https://www.mail-archive.com/tor-relays@lists.torproject.org/msg17760.html
## Since release-0.4.4.x now tor supports *two* "Address" statement which can be a hostname or IPv4 or IPv6 now.
#Address noname.example.com # <-This requires you to have working A and AAAA records.
#Address IPv4.address
#Address [IPv6::address]

## If you have multiple network interfaces, specify one for outgoing traffic to use.
## This option may be used twice, once with an IPv4 address and once with an IPv6 address.
#OutboundBindAddress IP.address
#OutboundBindAddress [IPv6::address]

## Set the nickname of this relay
#Nickname ididnteditheconfig

## Set your own contact info
## With a working email address, Tor Weather will inform you in the event of a downtime.
## Yes, it's back: https://github.com/thingless/torweather
#ContactInfo 0xFFFFFFFF Random Person <nobody AT example dot com>

## If you control multiple relays, include then in the family

## ORPort 443 & DirPort 80 is recommended if not used by another daemon on your server already.
## They're often some of the few open ports on public WIFI networks. Layer 3 filtering of ports is becoming more and more common on public networks :-(
## If your host supports IPv6, please enable it. NOTE: [New Feature] Relay IPv6 Address Discovery.

## DirPort is deprecated for non-authority relays and is only used for
